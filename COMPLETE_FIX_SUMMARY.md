# ✅ COMPLETE FIX - Scorecards & Stats

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Score Display Inconsistency** ✅
**Problem**: Matches 1-8 looked different from matches 9-16  
**Cause**: Matches had conflicting `scores.rcb`/`scores.opponent` AND `ourScore`/`theirScore` fields  
**Solution**: Removed old `scores` field from ALL 16 matches

### 2. **Stats Page Showing Wrong Wins** ✅
**Problem**: Stats page showed only 6 wins instead of 12  
**Cause**: Backend was checking for "Royal Challengers Bengaluru won" but results said "RCB won"  
**Solution**: Updated stats route to recognize both formats

### 3. **NRR Calculation Broken** ✅
**Problem**: Net Run Rate was calculating incorrectly  
**Cause**: Using removed `scores` field instead of `ourScore`/`theirScore`  
**Solution**: Updated NRR calculation to use correct fields
